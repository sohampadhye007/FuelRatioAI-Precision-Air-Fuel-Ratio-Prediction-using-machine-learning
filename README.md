## Team Veloce Racing #VRVELOCE

This data science project focuses on predicting the air-fuel ratio of a vehicle using recorded ECU data, including RPM, temperature, throttle position, and more. Through the application of linear regression, random forest, and decision tree algorithms, this project aims to enhance fuel efficiency and optimize engine performance for improved vehicle emissions and overall driving experience.

Engine Performance Enhancement: Designed an end-to-end pipeline for Air-Fuel Ratio (AFR) prediction, involving ECU data collection and map modifications, leading to substantial vehicle performance improvements. Utilizing Decision Tree, Random Forest, Regression, and Neural Network models, the project achieved a remarkable 0.99 accuracy on real testing data
